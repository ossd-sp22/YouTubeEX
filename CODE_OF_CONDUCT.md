# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Pledge

We as members and contributors to this project pledge to make this community harassment-free for everyone--regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Welcoming newcomers and guiding them with care
* Being respectful to everyone--even if they have differing opinions
* Practicing patience and grace when someonen asks a question
* Being open to criticism
* Showing kindness to all members of the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Making insulting/sexualized remarks to anybody
* Responding in a hostile way and causing unnecessary conflict
* Threatening someone in any way, shape, or form  
* Anything else that would be deemed inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Responsibilities

Project leaders are responsible for making the rules written in this Code of Conduct clear to all members of the community. They also have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces--as well as instances when an individual is representing the community in a public space. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, and other unacceptable behavior must be
reported by contacting <pp1950@nyu.edu>. Complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in whatever response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project leaders are also obligated to keep a level of confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
