# YouTubeEX

A Firefox plugin that makes [YouTube](https://youtube.com) *slightly* less distracting.

## Focus Features
* Hides the Youtube homepage, suggested feed, and end screen suggested videos so that you don't go down a YouTube rabbit-hole.
* Keeps the YouTube sidebar hidden
* Also hides the YouTube comments. As the old addage goes: "Never read the comments."


## Features To Be Implemented
* Add menu to allow the user to toggle which elements get hidden
