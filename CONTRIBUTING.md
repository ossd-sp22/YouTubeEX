# Contributing to YouTubeEX

Here's a quick guide to get you on board with our project!

## What's What?

In order to learn how FireFox extensions work, check out this [tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension) by Mozilla. 

The main file you'll need to work on/edit is the [youtubeex.js](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/YouTubeEX/blob/main/youtubeex.js) file in our root directory. 

## But I Can't Program!

No worries! We still greatly appreciate non-programming contributions such as bug reporting and new feature requests!

If we like your suggestions, we may even put them in our main [README.md](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/YouTubeEX/blob/main/README.md) file.

You can test out our program and write your findings and thoughts in our [issues page](https://github.com/ossd-sp22/YouTubeEX/issues). 

## How Can I Submit My Code?
